# 2048-GAME
📌 Overview
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic 2048 game, developed in Python. The game involves combining numbered tiles by swiping in four directions (up, down, left, right) to reach the 2048 tile — or keep going for a high score!

The project focuses on clean game logic, smooth matrix manipulation, and a responsive user experience.

🔧 Features
✅ Grid Initialization: Starts with a 4x4 grid and spawns a 2 (or rarely 4) tile randomly.
✅ Move Handling: Supports up, down, left, and right swipes with intuitive keyboard controls.
✅ Matrix Manipulation: Implements functions for compression, merging, reversing, and transposition — ensuring efficient gameplay and tile movements.
✅ Random Tile Spawning: After each valid move, a new 2 or 4 spawns at a random empty cell.
✅ Win/Lose Conditions: Detects a win when a tile reaches 2048 and a loss when no more moves are possible.
✅ Interactive Controls: Smooth user input handling for continuous, uninterrupted gameplay.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: random (for tile spawning) and os (optional for clear screen)

Environment: Compatible with any Python interpreter (3.x recommended)

🚀 How to Run the Game
Clone the repository:

bash

🎮 How to Play
Use W (up), S (down), A (left), D (right) keys to slide the tiles.

Tiles with the same number merge into one when they collide, forming larger numbers.

Your goal: Reach the 2048 tile to win!

The game ends when no valid moves remain.
